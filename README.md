# Sproutify

This is the code-base for [sproutify.org](http://www.sproutify.org).

Sproutify is an open-source project that aims to make gardening accesible, social, and fun. Users can manage and share what produce they are looking for and have available.

The initial project was built at Dev Bootcamp by Cole Pilegard, Michael Ho, Greg Varias, and Adam Loo.
